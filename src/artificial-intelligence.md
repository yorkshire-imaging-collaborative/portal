## Our AI Vision
Radiology is on the cusp of a computational science revolution which stands to change every step of the medical imaging pipeline. From the point of requesting a study through to the point of result delivery and action, smart processing tools stand to improve our processes if designed and integrated well.

Yorkshire Imaging Collaborative have taken a different approach to this journey to many early adopters. Make no mistake, we are an early adopter, but we have focussed heavily on laying the groundworks and regional infrastructure to produce a fertile and productive environment for articifial intelligence research and development. We have taken this approach avoiding early industry partnerships and one-off integrations in order to produce a combined academic and technology sandbox capable of supporting a wide range of studies and translational use cases at a regional level.

In December 2019 we established an academic partnership with The University of Leeds department of Computational Science.
