Enterprise Imaging has powerful hanging protocols to speed up the display of current and prior radiological images retrieved from PACS. Configured correctly, this can significantly speed up a reporter's workflow. However the initial configuration of the hanging protocols is something which end users seem to find very challenging and tend to only carry out once in the beginning.

This is the recording of a workshop held by Agfa Healthcare in order to try and school us in being able to create, update and adapt hanging protocols.

Intended for: PACS managers, radiologists, radiographers with reporting or PACS interest.
