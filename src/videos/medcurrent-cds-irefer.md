Martin Kepa from [Medcurrent](https://www.medcurrent.com/) provides a walkthrough demonstration and takes questions from the YIC Core Team around their iRefer product in partnership with the Royal College of Radiologists.

Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is a type of AI software that allows interception of requests at the point of referral to step into the process and provide advice and guidance for the referrer towards a known pathway. iRefer is a bank of referral guidance maintained since 1989 by the Royal College of Radiologists.

CDS is an effective way of managing the pre-acquisition input stage of radiology workflows in a regional network by sharing protocols created by our special interest groups with mappings to iRefer and specified NICIP codes.
