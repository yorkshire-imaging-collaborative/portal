An interesting point in history. When the YIC team visited Mid Yorkshire Hospitals in March 2018, we recorded a live questions and answers session. At this point in time, they were living in expectation of installing a new Enterprise Imaging PACS and the Xero viewer to their clinical teams. They were interested in exploring the challenges that this project would bring.

Much has since changed, but all of the aformentioned milestones where achieved on time with a minimal level of disruption which was rapidly resolved within a few months.
