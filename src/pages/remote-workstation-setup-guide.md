**Your remote reporting equipment is owned by your NHS Trust. It is on loan to you for the purposes of remote working.**

Please remember that when you accept a YIC remote reporting station you are taking possession of a very expensive set of equipment for which you become the responsible custodian.

**It is your responsibility to take care of it with the following measures:**

* Select a safe, well secured environment
* Reduce human damage factors such as pets, children, food and drink
* Add expensive equipment as named items to your home insurance
* You will be responsible for the replacement of any broken equipment either via insurance or our of pocket
