The Yorkshire Imaging Collaborative is excited to announce that we are now accepting applications for our AI seed fund. 

The fund is designed to support operational clinical trials of existing radiology AI solutions which can be readily purchased 'off the shelf today'. It is not intended to specifically fund research and algorithm development although we would welcome publications and (unfunded) research opportunities resulting from products deployed using this fund.

Successful applicants will receive a fixed-term award of upto Â£40,000, allowing them to carry out a structured evaluation of their proposed solution. This will help us to better understand the capabilities and limitations of the trialled technology, and to inform our decision-making as we look to procure AI solutions at a regional network scale.

### Who can apply?

The fund is open to Trusts who are active members of the Yorkshire Imaging Collaborative regional imaging network.

An application should identify the following key stakeholders:

* Supporting Clinical Director of Radiology Department
* Clincial Lead Radiologist for the AI project
* An Executive Sponsor from the Trust
* Lead Clinician outside of Radiology (where relevant - eg. an ED or Chest Physician, Orthopaedic Surgeon or Rheumatologist )

In addition, the following stakeholders should be consulted before submission of an application so that we can be assured of their in principle support:

* Radiology Service Manager
* Radiology IT / PACS Team

Areas of particular interest to our organisation are solutions which:

1. Improve patient safety
2. Improve diagnostic accuracy and certainty
3. Accelerate patient care pathways

To apply for the fund, please submit a detailed proposal outlining your proposed solution, including information on the technology, the problem it aims to solve, and the potential benefits for patients and the healthcare system. You should also include details of the core team who will be leading the project and reporting their findings to YIC.

### Evaluation of your project

Our goal is to fund the automation of radiology services to improve the outcome factors highlighted above.

Your project will be evaluated in running with presentations from the lead clinician at set time intervals, as well as check in meetings to hear about progress. We will be running a series of AI Seed Fund workshops throughout the year to discuss progress and hear these presentations.

1. **Interim deployment report** (following go-live to detail experiences and challenges in launching the AI solution into clinical use)
2. **Evaluation report** (1-year after live launch to review usage volume and clinical impact)

We look forward to receiving your proposals and working with the successful applicant to bring innovative AI solutions to the patients and healthcare providers of Yorkshire.

## How we decide which projects to progress

After the closing date, we will review the applications for a number of criteria in conjunction with the Clinical Directors of each Trust who have submit an application.

In the event of multiple suitable applications YIC will work with the Clinical Director to make a decision on which project to progress with the award. This will take into consideration:

1. Strength of the application and its suitability as a project for the Trust applying
2. Other projects taking place around the region (looking for similarity and duplication etc)
3. Feasibility to execute the project in the Trust based on review of position and resourcing
4. Possibility of duplication meaning that a joint venture with another Trust could be carried out (i.e. 2 x trusts trialling the same AI tool together and pooling awarded funds)
5. The chosen AI company will meet with YIC Clinical Director and Senior Programme Manager to ensure that they understand the terms of the award funding

In the event of no suitable application from a Trust, the remaining funds will be awarded across the other projects in addition to the basic standard award given.
