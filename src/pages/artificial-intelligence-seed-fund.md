The Yorkshire Imaging Collaborative is excited to announce that we are now accepting applications for our AI seed fund. This fund is designed to support clinical trials of existing radiology AI solutions rather than funding original research.

The fund will award a fixed term a﻿ward to the successful applicant, allowing them to carry out a structured evaluation of their proposed solution. This will help us to better understand the capabilities and limitations of the technology, and to inform our decision-making as we look to procure AI solutions at a regional network scale.

### W﻿ho can apply?

T﻿he application must include a named lead radiologist as a minimum, an executive sponsor who has agreed to endorse the project and ideally (where relevant) a lead contributing clinician.

A﻿reas of particular interest to our organisation are solutions which:

* I﻿mprove patient safety
* I﻿mprove diagnostic accuracy and certainty
* Accelerate patient care pathways

To apply for the fund, please submit a detailed proposal outlining your proposed solution, including information on the technology, the problem it aims to solve, and the potential benefits for patients and the healthcare system. You should also include details of the core team who will be leading the project and reporting their findings to YIC.

### E﻿valuation of your project

O﻿ur goal is to fund the automation of radiology services to improve the outcome factors highlighted above.

Y﻿our project will be assessed with presentations from the lead clinician at time intervals, as well as check in meetings to hear about progress.

1﻿. **Interim deployment report** (following go-live to detail experiences and challenges in launching the AI solution into clinical use)
2﻿. **Evaluation report** (1-year after live launch to review usage volume and clinical impact)

We look forward to receiving your proposals and working with the successful applicant to bring innovative AI solutions to the patients and healthcare providers of Yorkshire.

**A﻿pplications will be opened following the Yorkshire Imaging Collaborative Programme Board Meeting**
