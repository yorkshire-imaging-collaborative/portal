subtitle: Our regional PACS network and insource reporting pool enable member Trusts to access a wide area network of specialists willing to carry out additional paid work. Clearer backlogs and enhanced access to expertise within the NHS reduces the need for more expensive private outsourcing.

## Why reinvent the wheel?

Traditionally NHS Trusts have been unable to meet the needs of fast growing radiology services due to the large shortfall in supply _vs_ demand in the United Kingdom. This has led to the widespread use of private outsourcing of reporting services. Ironically it is frequently NHS radiologists who carry out this service in their own homes, paid by the outsourcing company who also take a _middle man_ fee.

By creating our own analogue _the insource network_ we are able to provide a framework to carry out the same activity for additional remuneration without a privately owned middle man. This allows us to deliver a cost saving to participating NHS Trusts whilst offering the reporter a more attractive fee schedule.

### Benefits of YIC-insource

* Cost saving against outsourcing
* Familiarity of worker pool
* Quality assurance of in-network specialists
* Oversight of area reporting by special interest groups
* Zero capital investment in solution
* Centralised business process management
* Home workstations provided at zero cost

### Infrastructure for insourcing

Considerable effort and resource is required in the creation of an insource network. Our network represents the sum of several YIC Masterplan milestones which contribute to a robust network framework in which our member Trusts can transparently interoperate.

* Tech infrastructure to work remotely
* Governance agreements
* Rules of engagement for reporters
* Service Manager's guide
* Regional Tariff System

## Making use of Insourcing

The insource network is open to all active YIC member Trusts in good standing.

Radiology services who have a need for additional reporting capacity may nominate work to be pushed to the regional insource reporting pool but always retain control over which work is forwarded. In addition they may also request reporting by assigned specialists or the general credentialled worker pool.

**Studies may be forwarded to the insource pool in a number of ways**
* Manually for a batch of identified work assigned to the regional pool
* Automatically based on rules created for studies on local PACS

### Charging
Trusts are charged for work carried out by the insource service based on the Regional Tariff System to which they must agree to adhere as a rule of participation. The system offers flexibility to incentivise work by increasing complexity by band if there is a specific focussed need.

Trusts will be cross-charged for activity carried out each month, which will be tracked by the YIC Central Business Intelligence Unit who will provide a simple summary of activity and payments to be made between providers.

Reporters will be reimbursed for work they carry out by their own Trust who will then receive cross-charge reimbursement for the work as above.

### NICIP coding
The importance of accurate coding using the NICIP system within your Radiology Information System (RIS) cannot be overemphasised enough. This is the mechanism by which YIC will identify which activity has been carried out and apply the appropriate charge coding to calculate

* Cost to Trust
* Fee paid to reporter

_Inaccuracies in NICIP coding may lead to unexpected reimbursements._ However, this is something which we will be using our Central Business Intelligence Unit to heuristically survey and adapt to standardisation as the network matures.

_A complete lookup table of NICIP code mappings per described radiology activity will be published as part of the tariff system_

## Regional Tariff System

Service         |   Reporting Tariff
------------    |   -------------
Plain Film (1-2 view)      |   £3.00
Plain Film (>2 views)      |   £5.50
CT band 1 / single         |   £25.00
CT band 2 / 2 area†         |   £36.00
CT band 3 / 3 area†         |   £47.00
CT band 4 / 4 area† / complex study         |   £55.00
MR band 1 / single         |   £25.00
MR band 2 / 2 area†         |   £36.00
MR band 3 / 3 area†         |   £47.00
MR band 4 / 4 area† / complex study         |   £55.00

> † Contiguous or overlapping areas in same acquisition i.e. abdomen and pelvis

Banded activities are mapped to descriptive terms of reference commonly used for radiological activity based on combinations of NICIP codes. To successfully utilise the tariff system, normalisation of usage of NICIP codes is necessary. [View the NICIP lookup table we maintain](https://airtable.com/shrbvdfjlW2GOT1Dx/tblfjDTT1LWVTT4IP)

#### The great body part debate
Radiologists who carry out additional work have long debated what constitutes _a part_ and we are in full appreciation of the limitations of each method of counting beans. The YIC tariff system uses the term _banding_ to avoid this territory. A band can equate to body parts but can also be used to indicate a higher level of complexity.

Special Interest Groups will be allowed to ask for review of tariffs in specialist areas if they consider the price band currently rated for a procedure to be a mismatch to the actual level of complexity and time required for the task. However, this claim will also be measured against the average reporting time for the claimed activity.

#### How prices are managed
Pricing will change with time and will not remain frozen at these levels forever. Adjustments will be made on a quarterly basis where necessary based on the following factors for consideration at Transformation Design Authority Board meetings.

1. Overall NHS tariff for the procedure
2. Market rate in outsourcing-land
3. Rated complexity by Special Interest Group
4. Average time to report (based on our business analytics)
