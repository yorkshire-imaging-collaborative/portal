title: Peer Learning & Feedback
subtitle: Shared learning is a core value of our regional imaging network underpinning our collaborarive ethos. This guide aims to help you scale up your usual learning and feedback methods to suit the needs of a larger and wider network of reporting radiologists and radiographers.

## Group for REALM chairs

If you are already the chair of your local Radiology Events and Learning Meeting <abbr title="Radiology Events and Learning Meeting">(REALM)</abbr> or aspire to take on this role, then you will find this meeting useful. It acts as a knowledge sharing and peer support network for meeting leads, and a place to discuss

* How to organise a good <abbr title="Radiology Events and Learning">REAL</abbr> Meeting
* A workflow for sharing and review of learning cases
* How to record and share learning
* Common pitfalls to avoid

As a peer group meeting, there is no group lead but meetings will be formally organised by YIC and minutes shared in the Peer Learning Special Interest Group.

## Cross regional feedback framework

Functioning as a sophisticated regional imaging network requires a mechanism to communicate feedback amongst peers regardless of working situation. This is increasingly important as we move towards remote working and cross-region insourcing.

### Positive feedback

Give a colleague a pat on the back for some good work.

It might be a case you see come through your <abbr title="Multidisciplinary Team Meeting">MDTM</abbr> or just a case that you happen upon during comparison. However you find good work, it is important to let each other know both directly and by entering the case into the Regional Peer Learning Meeting.

#### Ways you can give positive feedback
* Enter the case into the [Regional Peer Learning Meeting](#Regional Peer Learning Meeting)
* Send a digital pat on the back _(feature to be developed after establishment of regional insource network)_

### Peer Learning
We know that you've got robust Trust <abbr title="Radiology Events and Learning Meeting">REAL</abbr>
 Meetings but it's good to share some of that learning far and wide. The [Regional Peer Learning Meeting] is a virtual event showcasing the best learning cases nominated by radiologists and radiographers working in our regional insource network.

 #### What makes a good learning case?
 * Examples of a great pickup or a good report
 * Radiology which had a positive impact on care
 * Events from which we can learn and improve
 * Something difficult or misinterpreted with a specific learning point

## Regional Peer Learning Meeting

The regional peer learning meeting is a virtual event with similarities to Trust based REAL meetings. It is uniquely dedicated to the act of educating and learning from radiology practice using real life cases which have passed through out network. The event allows participants to obtain CPD points and acts as a good source for reflective practice by considering how the cases included would be handled in Trusts irrespective of the actual location of the case.

_The virtual Regional REAL Meeting is planned to take place after the establishment of the regional insource network in early 2022_

## Serious Untoward Events
Serious Untoward Events in Imaging <abbr title="Serious Untoward Events in Imanging">(SUIs)</abbr> remain a process governed and administered by the Trust in which the patient's primary care is delivered irrespective of when and where the imaging was acquired, interpreted and reported.

**It is feasible that a <abbr title="Serious Untoward Events in Imanging">(SUIs)</abbr> could arise from activity carried out in a number of cross Trust scenarios**

1. Specialist reports or advice given by an individual radiologist (primary or second opinion)
2. Advice received through a multidisciplinary team meeting <abbr title="multidisciplinary team meeting">(MDTM)</abbr> 
3. Insourced reporting by a radiologist or radiographer

If an event is said to have arisen through activity in the regional imaging network, YIC advocates that the event is investigated by the primary Trust in co-operation with the individual involved. If formal commentary is needed by an individual outside of that Trust who has carried out insourced work in the regional network, that particular radiologist or radiographer should be contacted by the Trust for input. 

#### Provision of Feedback

It is also good practice for a Trust to provide feedback to that individual irrespective of the need for formal comment, to enhance that person's learning and professional development.

This naturally includes the reinforcement of good practice through feedback, which is frequently observed during the investigation of a <abbr title="Serious Untoward Event in Imanging">SUI</abbr> yet seldom acknowledged due to the situation.
