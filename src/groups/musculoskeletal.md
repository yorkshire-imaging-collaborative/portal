groupKey: msk
subtitle: Musculoskeletal (MSK) radiology is a large subspecialism of general
  radiology concerning the diagnostic imaging of bones, joints, ligaments and
  tendons as well as skeletal manifestations of other diseases. It also
  encompasses a wide gamut of interventional procedures used predominantly to
  reduce inflammation, pain and increase function. MSK is sufficiently large to
  contain a number of sub-interests in its own right represented within this
  group.
