excerpt: Skeletal imaging and intervention.
subtitle: Musculoskeletal (MSK) radiology is a large subspecialism of general radiology concerning the diagnostic imaging of bones, joints, ligaments and tendons as well as skeletal manifestations of other diseases. It also encompasses a wide gamut of interventional procedures used predominantly to reduce inflammation, pain and increase function. MSK is sufficiently large to contain a number of sub-interests in its own right represented within this group.
