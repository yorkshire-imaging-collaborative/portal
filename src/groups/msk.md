Musculoskeletal (MSK) radiology is a large subspecialism of general radiology concerning the diagnostic imaging of bones, joints, ligaments and tendons as well as skeletal manifestations of other diseases. It also encompasses a wide gamut of interventional procedures used predominantly to reduce inflammation, pain and increase function. MSK is sufficiently large to contain a number of sub-interests in its own right.

Investigations are also frequently carried out by a diverse range of health professionals including: MSK Radiologists, Sonographers, Radiographers and also other health professionals such as Rheumatologists and some Physiotherapists. The SIG plays a vital role in overseeing shared professional standards across this landscape.
