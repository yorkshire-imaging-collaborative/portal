  ## Phase 2


  **Feb/March 2024**


  In person training undertaken at all Trusts.


  This should be in the form of a drop in roadshow for reporters to attend when available.


  Training in larger Trusts should be 11am-6pm to make use of lunch periods and the period immediately after normal working day.Â  Leeds Teaching Hospitals will require 2 days to cover their main 2 sites (Leeds General Infirmary and St James University Hospital)


  Training in smaller Trusts should be 11am-3pm to make use of the lunch period.


  We envisage that there will be 10 reporter to be trained in each of the larger Trusts (and on each site of the Leeds Trust) and 3-4 at the smaller Trusts.


  Consideration with timing will need to take account of school holidays which will be mid February and Easter which falls at the end of March/beginning of April.
