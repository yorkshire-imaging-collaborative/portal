### Actions

1. To approach Agfa to determine the best way of deploying templates to Trusts [Closed]
2. To send DT Trust CT Protocols [Ongoing for Helen Jeffrey]
3. To create reporting standard templates for pancreatic cancer staging, anal cancers and rectal cancer, to then use SIG members to sense check [new for Damian Tolan]
4. To arrange an ad hoc meeting to agree CT protocols within the next 6 months [new for Helen Jeffrey]
    
### Key Discussion Points

* Agfa had fed back to say that there was no way to centrally role out templates within EI. Instead, the YIC website could be used to publish reporting standard templates to include placeholder fields for Trusts to manually input them. 
* It was agreed to reduce the level of difficulty, that one person creates a template and seeks a second opinion before it is uploaded to PACS.
* It was raised that principles of collaborative CT protocols needed agreeing, so a separate meeting to do this would be beneficial.
* There was agreement that it would be helpful for radiographers to receive mandatory training in cancer staging. Liver and rectal MR could be focussed on and collaborative approach across the group.
* A comprehensive CTC Audit could be captured through YIC to allow Trusts or individuals to measure improvements in comparison to others.
