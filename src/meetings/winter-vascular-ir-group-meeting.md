  * The collaborative WHO checklist was circulated. Input and feedback was asked from members of the group and a formal route of approval for use in Trusts was required.

  * The consent guidelines were there to document that a discussion had taken place. Further education was required for staff so there is a consistent approach and an accurate record.
