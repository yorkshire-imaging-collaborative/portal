  * There were concerns around the mpMRI vs bpMRI study due to patients being randomised and not knowing which lesions were being missed. There were also concerns around the ethics and of enrolling patients to what could be an inferior scan for those who receive bi-parametric.

  * The group suggested that multi-parametric without dynamic contrast and then re-read by somebody with dynamic contrast would be a better study, separating it from cognitive fusion.

  * The introduction of TP biopsy in LTHT had been a success, and training sonographers and colleagues had commenced. HUTHT had also started the service, and other Trusts were in the process of getting funding.

  * There had been no issues using local anaesthetic with adrenaline and it was mentioned that the guidance was not to use antibiotics until further evidence.

  * It is important to maintain links in terms of shared learning and skills.
