  * The group was reminded of the original training rooms project in 2019, where Trusts were asked to identify suitable rooms to be upgraded or to receive a new fit out to facilitate cross-collaborative training of staff and support the work of the Special Interest Groups. The YIC business case had set aside Â£182K to implement this.

  * Next steps for Trusts to review the rooms that were allocated and confirm use of them. Trusts to then commence local projects to implement the training rooms.

  * YIC will be approaching Trusts with a requirement for information to contribute to the YIC benefits plan. This includes: -Number of homeworking stations implemented -No of radiologists (HWS) & how many are doing Insource work -No of reporting radiographer (HWS) & how many are doing Insource work -Good news stories around homeworking

  * Cost benefits would also be looked at once the sharing solution was live - run a report at intervals to see how much has been spent on the central team and collaborative insourcing compared to how much would have been spent using external outsourcing companies.
