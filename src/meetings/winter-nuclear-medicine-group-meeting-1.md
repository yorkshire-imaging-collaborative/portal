  * The group agreed that a standardised patient information leaflet was the right direction to go in. It was important to not provide patients with too much information as it could cause points to be missed, and patients may have to re-book their test.

  * The group thought that an educational piece at the end of every NM SIG would be a good opportunity to share best practice and learning.
