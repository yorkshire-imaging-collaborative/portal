  **A﻿ny Other Business**


  Dear Chest SIG member


  Just to confirm that I am standing down as chair. The role has been very enjoyable and what the Chest SIG did during covid was felt to be useful. The Chest SIG has taken steps towards Radiographer reporting standards and has come together to create a minimum CT dataset for most of the chest imaging.


  Soon the insourced reporting will start and new issues will be raised both with insourcing and other chest related issues.


  I would recommend you all consider putting yourselves up for chest SIG lead. Although it doesn’t attract any formal PA / sessions work, the role is as strong or as light as you want it. The main role would be to take chest imaging in the YIC forward  - being the spokes person for chest imaging specialists in the region.


  Please let myself know or any of the YIC management team. The emails will be provided on this message
