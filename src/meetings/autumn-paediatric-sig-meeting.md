  ## Minutes


  Admin


  * HW offered to host next meeting in person in Leeds at the Radiology Academy

  * Any staff not part of the Paeds Whats App group to contact LH or SIG PM's

  * It was discussed that Paeds SIG was a good platform to host training days. In future was discussed a small fee would be charged to reduce "no shows"

  * Study day on skeletal survey for suspected abuse was a great success with positive feedback


  US Abdo Pain


  * Discussion around if the scan needs to be done overnight since acutely unwell paeds will go direct to surgery, so any others could wait until in hours when specialists available. Also this will reduce the need to repeat scans that may have been suboptimal due to lack of expertise

  * IF they do require cross sectional imaging overnight, CT is the only modality OOH that has capacity to scan

  * US OOH guide document produced with " Top Tips" this will be sent out to all

  * Paediatric acute abdominal pain and appendectomy 2022 + GIRFT


  MRI


  * Neonate MRI Brain and NAI

  * Once protocols have been collated, to be sent out to members (JH)


  Learning Disability Patients


  * LTHT only trust to have a disability team

  * Discussion on how to identify these patients before they present in radiology- alarms on RIS since PPM doesn't connect to RIS

  * Emphasis was placed on the referrer to inform us via the request

  * PEC cards and little book of fluoroscopy were shared and discussed as tools to aid these patients. Agreed for this resource to be shared across all trusts. JN to compile and share.
