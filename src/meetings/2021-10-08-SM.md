## Agenda
This is what we are going to discuss in this meeting

* Service Model
* Workforce
* Any Other Business

## Minutes

### Attendance
_Sarah Clenton, Gary Cooper, Mark Lang, Louise Diamond, Ruth Kent, Gill Hicks, Jen Green_
    
### Key Discussion Points
* Gary thanked members for the feedback from those who have received homeworking stations so far.
* The shared reporting team would not be in control of Trust KPIs, and work from Trusts would not be lost sight of when on the collaborative worklist. It was confirmed that operational and financial accountability would sit with individual Trusts, and the hosting organisation for the shared reporting team would provide the HR and governance functions.
* EOIs for the workforce & capital equipment project managers had been shortlisted. All those applied were radiographers, and it was key that secondments shouldn't impact service needs. Those successful would need to agree secondments with the service manager.
* Members agreed to attend weekly meetings on a Friday to discuss operational matters, including the 6 week wait performance.
