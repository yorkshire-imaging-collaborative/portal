  * Guidance had been released from the RCR after a case of a child who died whilst under GA, where the parents had never officially consented to this. The guidance states that specific consent for GA is required, and confirmation that parents and guardians have been made aware of risks associated.
  
  * It was felt that paediatric colleagues should specifically ask for consent before the case is sent to Radiology.  
  
  * BTHFT have a system where a specific code should be inputted onto the system if a case that needs GA for imaging is required. If the code has not been specified then it is bounced back to the paediatrician. 
  
  * It was agreed that the RCR was the recommended guidance to use (available on the YIC website)

It was agreed that producing minimum data sets for some specific MRI protocols would be useful so that Trusts have a basis of what to do for examinations.
  
The group agreed a list of protocols that would be looked at:
  * Neo-Natal Brain Imaging
  * Paediatric Brain Imaging - under and over 2
  * MR Whole Spine
  * NAI Protocols
  * Limping Child
  * Abdominal Pain
  * Paediatric Lump
  * Tumour Screening 
  * Enterography

  * There was discussion regarding how much advice colleagues could give to other Trusts that doesn't exceed their service level agreement. 

  * The group agreed that an informal process would be helpful for members to posts any questions.

  * YIC would feedback to the group what the process for second opinions was.
