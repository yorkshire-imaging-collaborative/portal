  ## K﻿ey Discussion Points


  G﻿eneral Discussion around symptomatic 2 week wait; all services across the region meeting target. Leeds using a locum service Sat/Sun, also some transition in regard to consultant radiographers. NLAG in the middle of major refurbishment.


  G﻿eneral Discussion around screening services; all good across the region.


  Q﻿A for breast screening; Process is changing and rather than each unit having QA,  sites will be asked for data and QA will visit sites that need support


  B﻿reast Biopsy Leeds Service; currently not able to provide this service due to a coil issue, Bradford are helping to provide this service for now.


  M﻿ammography Training; Jon McConnell updated the group about Leeds university suspending the PGC course in Mammography. Alternative universities providing this are Salford, Nottingham and London. Agreed that a survey be sent out to all teams to understand the training needs across the region. An interim meeting may be set up regarding this issue with Service Managers/ Principal Radiographers.
