  ### K﻿ey Discussion Points


  1﻿.\tJames Baren- new Chair


  2﻿. Sarcoma Pathway- Phil Robinson gave background to the updated pathway
  (new flow chart approved through Cancer Alliance and Rob Turner
  (oncologist))  To prevent patients having to travel to Leeds and the undue
  anxiety of being referred to the “Sarcoma” clinic. This is now a “live”
  document as far as the radiologists are concerned. Main change was the
  threshold for referral for subcutaneous lipoma that has no concerning features
  from 7cm to 10cm. If there is cosmetic or pain concern then the GP will refer
  to plastic surgery. This new pathway to be uploaded to the YIC website (action
  for SIG PMs)\r

  Discussion around standardisation of MRI in “lumps” e.g T1, T2 FS or STIR in
  one or two planes and gadolinium not required (happy for this protocol to be
  adopted)\r

  Discussion around use of DIXON technique.\ 

  \r

  Document discussion around standard protocol, use the YIC principle of a
  minimum dataset and publish on the MSK SIG page on website (action for SIG PMs
  to circulate)


  3.\tPrimary Care Diagnostic Referral Pathway for U/S

  Phil Robinson gave background to this document. Need for written guidance
  for GPs to refer to. With aim to restrict referrals. Discussion around hernia
  referrals, shoulder pain, masses. \r

  Use YIC to make sure this applies. Phil R happy for us to use the document
  with a YIC format for circulation and agreement. (action SIG PMs)\r
