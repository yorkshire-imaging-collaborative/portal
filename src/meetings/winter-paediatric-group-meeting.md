  * The paediatric stroke pathway had not been approved yet - a decision was required to identify who would confirm it is a stroke, would a CTA or CT head be required and who would decide the further action that is required?

  * Trusts were supporting other Trusts for reporting and carrying out surveys for child safeguarding. Alder Hey had provided guidance that sedation is not required to carry out the survey.

  * For non-accidental injury, if a CT head and skeletal survey is positive, then an MRI is done. If chosen to not proceed with an MRI then reasons for doing so need to be documented.

  * The new guidance from the baby hip screen protocol is to try and scan on the 5th week.
