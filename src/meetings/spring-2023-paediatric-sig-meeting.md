  #### M﻿inutes


  A﻿ presentation about MRI Enterography was given by Helen Woodley with a discussion around the topic following on.


  A﻿ discussion took place about paediatric sonographers and training, is there a need for it? York has a competency sheet, this is especially useful for the booking office as they know who is trained for specific examinations.


  M﻿RI protocols were also discussed, the consensus was that each centre should do what they are happy with.


  L﻿ouise announced that she would be stepping down as chair of the paediatric SIG. She hoped that someone would be interested in taking on the role as she has found the meetings really helpful even if it was just to realise that the battles faced are across the region. She also commented that it had been really good to learn from each other and probably the thing she was proudest of was the YIC study days.
