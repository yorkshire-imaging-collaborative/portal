## Minutes

### Attendance
_Paula Marsh, Ashley Uttley, Hlupekile Chipeta, Tracey Glanville, Sandra Morrissey, Gary Cooper_

### Actions

1. Lead sonographers to provide the guidance they follow in terms of rejection [new for Paula Marsh]
    
### Key Discussion Points

* Some Trusts were using 12 follicles rather than Rotterdan 20 to diagnose polycystic ovaries.
* The group wanted to understand what protocols trusts were using in order to standardise rejection and produce a minimum baseline.
* Some Trusts had started to use 3D scanning for things such as coil placement.
* LTHT were looking at the use of Cine for endometriosis. Storage on PACS could be an issue, so an idea of video length would be helpful.
