  ***Attendance***


  James Baren, Conrad Nel, David Howarth, Gillian Barber, Lisa Field, Martin Hampshire, Jo Sharratt, Kelly Robinson, Scott Raine, Manjusha Salins


  ***Scoliosis Protocols***


  •	Standing radiographs can be performed for children at any age who are able to stand, however the majority of imaging will be done at LTHT following spinal team assessment



  •	Scoliosis MRI should not be performed prior to surgical review



  •	MRI can be performed locally, but the majority of imaging will normally be performed in LTHT



  •	Scoliosis MR protocol:

  o	T1 sag cervical 

  o	T2 TSE coronal thoracolumbar

  o	T1 SE coronal thoracolumbar

  o	T2 space coronal thoracolumbar


  ***Scaphoid pathway***


  •	LTHT has seen the number of scaphoid MRI requests escalate following conversion from bone scan to MRI as 2nd line imaging



  •	MidYorks: 2nd line imaging CT after 2 radiographs showing no fracture. Only a small proportion of patients have MRI after this



  •	Harrogate: 2nd line MRI after 2 radiographs



  •	Harrogate use streamlined MR protocol with coronal STIR/T1 only. Perhaps this is something to consider for other Trusts performing MRI as second line imaging



  •	LTHT planning on auditing referrals for MR scaphoid (JB)


  ***CT myelograms for suspected CES***


  •	CT myelograms should not be performed prior to spinal surgical review for patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome who are unable to have MRI. CT myelogram is not a substitute for spinal surgical assessment



  •	CT myelogram can be performed locally in selected outpatients following spinal surgical review if local teams feel able to support this


  ***Educational case***


  •	Dr Salins presented a case of failed reverse total shoulder replacement.



  •	Learning point was to always check prior imaging and seek advice if you are unfamiliar with an implant


  ***AOB***


  •	MidYorks (CN/DH) to trial limited sag T2 to exclude CES in patients repeatedly presenting to the Emergency Department, as per national pathway. CN/DH to share any published data or clinical guidelines before discussing at the next meeting. 



  •	Link to spinal surgery CES GIRFT pathway:

  •	Please share any thoughts about what should/should not be included in the meeting moving forwards to be beneficial for all



  •	Provisional date and time for next meeting: Wednesday 7th February 2024 (12-1pm)
