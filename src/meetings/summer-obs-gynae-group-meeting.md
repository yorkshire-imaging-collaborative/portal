  ### Key Discussion Points


  #### Gynae Audit - MRI Findings


  * Dr Ujani Reid presented her findings from a 6 month gynae audit on MRI imaging and what examinations were being carried out at each Trust to diagnose gynaecological cancers (cervical and endometrial) 


  ***Presentation will be added***


  * RCR and ESUR protocols were quite similar, however agreeing standardised regional protocols would provide best practice for patients

  * For each Trust, an audit was taken of ESUR protocols and basic sequence protocols used for patients who were being examined - most Trusts carry out the basic sequence protocols as a minimum.

  * DWI wasn't carried out in the majority of Trusts, but was worth carrying out as diffusion would identify if something was borderline or malignant

  * There was the opportunity to carry out an MR audit for ovarian cancer.


  The group discussed how patients can have their follow up scans done locally instead - YIC agreed to follow this up.


  #### GP Referral Criteria


  * BTHFT had created a document showing what should and shouldn't be referred, with justification. When vetting, standard phrases were copied into the rejection. BTHFT were now working to communicate this with GPs.

  * MYHT were working with GPs throughout producing their criteria - their system was using the ICE referral route, so that it doesn't reach radiology via CRIS. If a GP tried to refer a patient where a referral wasn't required, ICE would notify the GP that this was not justified and show them guidance.

  * Teams felt that this was a good system to allow them not to have to vet referrals - this could be standardised across the region.


  #### Any Other Business


  * Paula Marsh was stepping down as chairperson for the Gynae side of the SIG.

  * This was a great opportunity for somebody to take over as chair, and lead the SIG to standardising regional protocols and pathways, and sharing best practice.

  * If any members are interested in taking on the role as chair, please contact yorkshireimagingcollaborative@nhs.net
