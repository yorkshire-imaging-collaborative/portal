  * Proposal for official radiographer NAI training day. Pricing will be identified and funding will be discussed with YIC.

  * Majority of Trusts would use ultrasound as the first imagine modality to diagnose appendictis. CT would be used if a teenager was unable to be diagnosed with ultrasound.

  * The need for SIGs to prirotise work prior to the sharing solution going live was raised. A good place to start was producing a minimum data set for CT protocols.

  * To assist with issues such as out of hours ultrasounds, collaborative working was discussed. Service managers were keen to explore a paediatric generalistic working environment, including a collaborative on call rota
