  * Some Trusts were using 12 follicles rather than Rotterdan 20 to diagnose polycystic ovaries.

  * The group wanted to understand what protocols trusts were using in order to standardise rejection and produce a minimum baseline.

  * Some Trusts had started to use 3D scanning for things such as coil placement.

  * LTHT were looking at the use of Cine for endometriosis. Storage on PACS could be an issue, so an idea of video length would be helpful.
