* Bone Scintigraphy Workflow 

## Minutes

### Attendance
_Chirag Patel, Jon Martin, Mike Page, Alison Burns, Melanie Palmer, H'ssein Al-Chalabi, Hesh Panditaratne, Ged Avery_
    
### Actions

1. Share LTHT spec CT protocols [new for Chirag Patel]
2. Raise the issue of Trust governance and documentation approval at the Transformation Board [new for Hesh Panditaratne]
    
### Key Discussion Points

* Aim of SIG groups is to have a collaborative repository where documents can be produced and shared, inlcuding imaging protocols and innovations as to how services are delivered.
* Radiographer training could also be a focus, to approach training collaboratively.
* Bone Scintigraphy was discussed at a previous meeting. It was agreed to focus on standardised patient information leaflets, vetting and imaging protocols. HDFT had produced patient letters that could be use as a basis to be adapted.
* Members felt that getting documentation approval through Trust governance was a long process and clarity was required as to how documentation can be approved for use in all YIC Trusts.
* It was agreed that training radiographers to report could also be a focus so that would learn CT to a level that would help departments and increase capacity.
