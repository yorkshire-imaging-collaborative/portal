## Minutes

### Attendance
_Chirag Patel, Debra Punshon, Jo Housley, Oliver Hough, Najeeb Ahmed, Jon Martin, Mike Page, Janet Hill, Akpan Spencer, Jacqueline Wilkinson_
    
### Actions

1. Collect and collate patient information leaflets, in order to produce a standardised regional NM patient information leaflet [new for SIG PMs]
    
### Key Discussion Points

* The group agreed that a standardised patient information leaflet was the right direction to go in. It was important to not provide patients with too much information as it could cause points to be missed, and patients may have to re-book their test.
* The group thought that an educational piece at the end of every NM SIG would be a good opportunity to share best practice and learning.
