  * Trusts had fewer Covid patients, but were seeing sick younger patients and patients presenting long COVID.

  * Increase in delayed cancer diagnoses and larger numbers of outpatient referrals

  * Some Trusts were struggling with reporting all insource work and were exploring AI with outsourcing companies - company would identify normal (double report) and abnormal chest X-rays. If abnormal, image transfers back to the Trust to report on.

  * An update was provided regarding the Intelerad sharing solution, with HDFT being rolles out first and then another Trust every month after that.

  * There was lack of clarity on who would teach the new trainees next year, with some teams having no capacity, and the issue of sub-specialty training once trainees reach this level. There was an ask of Trusts to provide what they currently teach and what they would be willing to teach.
