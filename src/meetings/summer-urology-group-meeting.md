  ### Key Discussion Points


  #### CT Urogram


  * Ese Adiotomore presented the findings of CT urography accuracy and scanning timings - Benefit of CTU is that it is a one stop process where the patient is then safely discharged back to primary care.

  * All agreed there was a good sample size and a pragmatic approach to something that has low prevalence amongst populations.

  * The group suggested gathering more data for CTU to demonstrate that important tumours weren't missed.


  #### TP Biopsy


  * CHFT will be up and running with their TP biopsy service in a couple of months time.

  * The service is working well in HUTHT.


  #### Training Opportunities


  * Olly noted that international radiologists were due to come to the UK to gain more experience, and would be working up a job plan for them.

  * It was agreed that FRCR would be a good baseline for competency.


  #### CRIS Codes


  * Different Trusts currently code CT urogram differently - this would need standardising across Trusts to allow accurate payment.

  * The group suggested raising this with the Trust service managers.
