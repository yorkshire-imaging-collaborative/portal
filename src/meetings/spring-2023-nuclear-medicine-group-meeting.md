  **K﻿ey Discussion Points** 


  Dr Ioan Prata introduced himself as the new chair and set out what he hopes to achieve from the group. He hoped that the group would be like a forum where we can talk and meet when possible. He suggested that we create a table stating which trusts do Nuclear Medicine , what key services are carried out at each trust and key personnel for best point of contact. This will enable the group to see where to go and who to go to if they need help and advice. He felt that Nuclear Medicine had a huge promotion problem which we would need to look at as a region.    


  Mike Page suggested either a shared email or Whatsapp group so that it is easier to reach out to colleagues in similar situations, however some of the group were not keen to have a Whatsapp group and preferred the email suggestion better as they could separate work from home life better.


  It was agreed that when the email group is set up, an email would be sent out in approximately 8 weeks to see when a meeting was needed.
