  * The purpose of the Cardiovascular SIG was was for subject matter experts to decide and agree what to focus on as a collaborative.

  * Dr Annette Johnstones volunteered to take on the role as chairperson for the SIG.

  * There was agreement that aortic valve calcification hadn't routinely been implemented across the collaborative, and a consensus of using the guidelines was required.

  * It was raised that TAVI CT scans and reporting takes longer to do. Trusts were modifying NICE guidelines to adapt to capacity and their out of hours CT service. There was opportunity to work on this as a collaborative.
