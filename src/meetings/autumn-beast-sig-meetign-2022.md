  ## A﻿ctions
        

  * Doodle Poll date for next meeting \\[For SIG PM]

  * Upload ALCL protocols to YIC website


  ### K﻿ey Discussion Points




  * Change in priorities for SIG group, support and guidance group, whilst still discussing common pathways/ new technologies and improvements in patient care

  * ALCL protocols reviewed, all trusts believe to be following a similar pathway.

  * Male breast protocol reviewed - All trusts currently have differing pathways- differences tended to be surgeon led and site dependant.


  Tomosynthesis-


  Most trusts have Tomosynthesis capabilities, diagnostic uses tend to differ between trusts. Discussion around Tomosynthesis needing to be double reported, local protocols in place.


  Contrast enhanced mammography: availability of equipment/infrastructure and cannulating staff was raised, limiting the capacity of this examination type. Directly impacting the need for more MRI.
