## Agenda

* Paediatric Stroke Pathway
* Thrombectomy Pathway

### Head & Neck

* Thyroid Core Biopsy vs. FNA

## Minutes

### Attendance
_D
    
### Actions

1. Gather Trust CT GI protocols. CT service leads to be contacted. [ongoing for Helen Jeffrey]
2. Approach Agfa to determine the best way of deploying templates to Trusts [new for Dan Fascia]
    
### Key Discussion Points

* Lung cancer screening means decreased capacity for CT colonoscopy. Audits and QA are important as there are national standards to meet, so the SIG would need to agree what to measure and publish.
* There is a requirement to share standardised EI templates. YIC are due to have a BI team in place who could choose reporting templates that would provide good data. The bowel cancer screening programme template could be adopted in Trusts and uploaded onto EI once this has been established.
* Direction of travel for shared collaborative CT protocols is producing a minimum data set, including a sequence rather than parameters. The document would have a broad selection criteria so Trusts don't have to use all protocols.
* Next steps are for the SIG to prioritise what work to focus on. There is opportunity SIG to look into doing some AI work.
