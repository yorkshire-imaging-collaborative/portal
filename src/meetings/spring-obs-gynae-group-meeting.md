  * The group agreed that CT and MRI protocols are varied across the region, and don't coincide with guidelines.

  * It was agreed that an LTHT registrar would attend the next meeting and present their protocols, to reset European standards.

  * We would need representatives from all Trusts to discuss CT/MRI protocols.

  * GP referrals was raised, and what criteria Trusts had for rejecting GP referrals.

  * HUTHT had done some work on this and had set criteria, MYHT were also working through this but struggling to implement with GPs. BTHFT were also hoping to start this work and would link with the other Trusts.

  * It was agreed that it would be beneficial to produce GP referral criteria as a region.
