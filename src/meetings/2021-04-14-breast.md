### Actions

1. No actions captured
    
### Key Discussion Points

* It was agreed that the automated breast ultrasound in WY&H would not be a feasible option as due to the time to report on the scan and the acquisition time.
* There was no region wide consensus for imaging women under 40 and some Trusts currently reviewed cases in MDTs to make a decision on whether to scan or not.
* AI project funding had been applied for by NHSE/I for LTHT and Humber Coast & Vale to assess breast density and quality assurance of mammograms. It would mean radiographers spend less time carrying out quality assurance. LTHT were into the second phase of approval and would confirm if they were successful in June.
