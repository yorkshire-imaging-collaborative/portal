3. To contact yorkshireimagingcollaborative@nhs.net with expressions of interests to form the radiographer reporting group, anticipating a meeting in December [new for members]
4. To set up a December meeting to look into/agree minimum data sets for scanning protocols - representatives from each Trusts required [new for Helen Jeffrey]
5. To send Trust reporting alert systems to yorkshireimagingcollaborative@nhs.net, to then be accessed on the YIC website [new for members]
    
### Key Discussion Points

* Some Trusts radiographer competencies had been received. It was agreed to form a small group to rationalise competenies and produce a radiographer YIC document.
* There was discussion around if there was a need to rationalise scanning protocols, but it was agreed that the group should strive to producing minimum data sets for scanning protocols for the ease of collaborative reporting and so patients receive the same imaging standards in every Trust.
* A supportive radiologist/radiographer group needs to be identified as this is a helpful function within outsourcing companies.
* The pricing matrix was now live on the YIC website (https://yorkshireimaging.nhs.uk/insourcing/). The special interest groups have the ability to raise if they thought a price was set incorrectly, which would then be taken up to the Transformation Board.
* It was raised that payment by accession numbers may be a better option to avoid the multiparts issue.
