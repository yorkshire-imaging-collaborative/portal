2. To confirm allocation of training rooms and timelines for implementation [new for Service Managers]
    
### Key Discussion Points

* The group was reminded of the original training rooms project in 2019, where Trusts were asked to identify suitable rooms to be upgraded or to receive a new fit out to facilitate cross-collaborative training of staff and support the work of the Special Interest Groups. The YIC business case had set aside Â£182K to implement this.
* Next steps for Trusts to review the rooms that were allocated and confirm use of them. Trusts to then commence local projects to implement the training rooms.
* YIC will be approaching Trusts with a requirement for information to contribute to the YIC benefits plan. This includes:
-Number of homeworking stations implemented
-No of radiologists (HWS) & how many are doing Insource work
-No of reporting radiographer (HWS) & how many are doing Insource work
-Good news stories around homeworking
* Cost benefits would also be looked at once the sharing solution was live - run a report at intervals to see how much has been spent on the central team and collaborative insourcing compared to how much would have been spent using external outsourcing companies.
