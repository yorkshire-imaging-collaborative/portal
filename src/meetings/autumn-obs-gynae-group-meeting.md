  * It was highlighted that attendance and engagement has been limited. It was agreed to send an updated terms of reference to members and set the day and time of the quarterley meetings.

  * Alison discussed sonographer apprenticeship training. LTHT and MYHT have received funding, and Sheffield Hallam are able to provide the training. The aim is to train to become a sonographer at band 5 level.

  * Peer review audit in Trusts was discussed, and it was established that the audit was not consistent across the collaborative with each Trust having a different process. Alison agreed to lead the work into creating minimum requirements for peer review and CPD.

  * It was agreed that collaborative reporting was not relevant for Obs & Gynae and that other priorities should be focussed on, but would require attendance from all Trusts to be able to agree.
