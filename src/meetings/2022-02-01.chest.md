### Actions
    
### Key Discussion Points
### Qualifications for reporting Radiographers in the YIC
All the sites that attended confirmed that the initial qualification is from the course at Bradford university. All attendees from the different trusts informed the group of their “training” requirements.
* Auditing work
* CPD  
* REAL meeting attendance 
Outcome: The gathered group felt that ongoing CPD, appraisal and REAL meeting attendance should be the requirements for remaining part of the group of reporting Radiographers in the YIC

### Medico legal safety
The discussion was about indemnity for reporting cases that were not part of the reporting radiographer’s trust. The Society of Radiographers provide a certain level of protection. 
Outcome: Ask the project managers team to contact the Society of radiographers to confirm indemnity agreements that are possible or are in place for our collaborative situation. Leeds colleagues mentioned that the SoR would cover a radiographer who is permanently based at a trust.
