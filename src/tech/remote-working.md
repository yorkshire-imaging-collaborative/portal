## Remote workstations

To suport the delivery of the wider sharing and reporting capability weâ€™re investing heavily to support radiologists and reporting radiographers to utilise this technology from home.  Home working stations are being provisioned to as part of the programme and will be delivered to reporters as we progress through the programme.

To support radiologists and reporting radiographers the following guides have been created to support the installation of this hardware at home

* Installation video (Link here)

## Display calibration

The diagnostic monitors provided with the home working stations are self-calibrating.  Calibration is automatically checked daily and any issues found are reported.

## IT support

Platinum support agreements are in place with the home working station hardware providers.  The following support processes are in place if any issues are found
