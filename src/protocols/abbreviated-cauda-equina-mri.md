### P﻿urpose

T﻿he volume of imaging of suspected cauda equina syndrome is a burden on acute imaging services, yet this is the gold standard imaging for the exclusion of this important condition. MR imaging is endorsed by every major learned body for this presentation.

T﻿he traditional full MR lumbar spine protocol is not necessary to answer the targetted question to exclude cauda equina compression. A limited scan protocol accelerates scan time and allows a higher throughput of these cases, with less disruption to surrounding scan load.

### P﻿rotocol

* T﻿2 Sagittal (4mm slice with saturation band across the aorta)
* Axial T2 across lesion level (At discretion of on-table image review by MR Radiographer)

### R﻿eporting

T﻿hese studies must be reported in a different way to the standard lumbar spine MR.

1. E﻿nsure that it is clearly stated "Limited Scope Examination for the exclusion of the Cauda Equina Syndrome"
2. L﻿imit the report to the findings pertinent to this presentation
3. M﻿ention only other findings considered relevant to the presentation (i.e. disc protrusion)

### G﻿overnance

I﻿t is paramount to ensure that there is an understanding amongst the referrers of the limited scope of the examination which will be offered in the acute emergency setting and that the stewardship of this study is a shared responsibility of the referring teams and radiology service.
