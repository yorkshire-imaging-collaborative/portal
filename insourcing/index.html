Clearer backlogs and enhanced access to expertise within the NHS reduces the need for more expensive private outsourcing.</p><h2 id="why-reinvent-the-wheel%3F">Why reinvent the wheel?</h2><p>Traditionally NHS Trusts have been unable to meet the needs of fast growing radiology services due to the large shortfall in supply <em>vs</em> demand in the United Kingdom. This has led to the widespread use of private outsourcing of reporting services. Ironically it is frequently NHS radiologists who carry out this service in their own homes, paid by the outsourcing company who also take a <em>middle man</em> fee.</p><p>By creating our own analogue <em>the insource network</em> we are able to provide a framework to carry out the same activity for additional remuneration without a privately owned middle man. This allows us to deliver a cost saving to participating NHS Trusts whilst offering the reporter a more attractive fee schedule.</p><h3 id="benefits-of-yic-insource">Benefits of YIC-insource</h3><ul><li>Cost saving against outsourcing</li><li>Familiarity of worker pool</li><li>Quality assurance of in-network specialists</li><li>Oversight of area reporting by special interest groups</li><li>Zero capital investment in solution</li><li>Centralised business process management</li><li>Home workstations provided at zero cost</li></ul><h3 id="infrastructure-for-insourcing">Infrastructure for insourcing</h3><p>Considerable effort and resource is required in the creation of an insource network.

In addition they may also request reporting by assigned specialists or the general credentialled worker pool.</p><p><strong>Studies may be forwarded to the insource pool in a number of ways</strong></p><ul><li>Manually for a batch of identified work assigned to the regional pool</li><li>Automatically based on rules created for studies on local PACS</li></ul><h3 id="charging">Charging</h3><p>Trusts are charged for work carried out by the insource service based on the Regional Tariff System to which they must agree to adhere as a rule of participation. The system offers flexibility to incentivise work by increasing complexity by band if there is a specific focussed need.</p><p>Trusts will be cross-charged for activity carried out each month, which will be tracked by the YIC Central Business Intelligence Unit who will provide a simple summary of activity and payments to be made between providers.</p><p>Reporters will be reimbursed for work they carry out by their own Trust who will then receive cross-charge reimbursement for the work as above.</p><h3 id="nicip-coding">NICIP coding</h3><p>The importance of accurate coding using the NICIP system within your Radiology Information System (RIS) cannot be overemphasised enough. This is the mechanism by which YIC will identify which activity has been carried out and apply the appropriate charge coding to calculate</p><ul><li>Cost to Trust</li><li>Fee paid to reporter</li></ul><p><em>Inaccuracies in NICIP coding may lead to unexpected reimbursements.</em> However, this is something which we will be using our Central Business Intelligence Unit to heuristically survey and adapt to standardisation as the network matures.</p><p><em>A complete lookup table of NICIP code mappings per described radiology activity will be published as part of the tariff system</em></p><h2 id="regional-tariff-system">Regional Tariff System</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Reporting Tariff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Plain Film (1-2 view)</td><td>£3.00</td></tr><tr><td>Plain Film (&gt;2 views)</td><td>£5.50</td></tr><tr><td>CT band 1 / single</td><td>£25.00</td></tr><tr><td>CT band 2 / 2 area†</td><td>£36.00</td></tr><tr><td>CT band 3 / 3 area†</td><td>£47.00</td></tr><tr><td>CT band 4 / 4 area† / complex study</td><td>£55.00</td></tr><tr><td>MR band 1 / single</td><td>£25.00</td></tr><tr><td>MR band 2 / 2 area†</td><td>£36.00</td></tr><tr><td>MR band 3 / 3 area†</td><td>£47.00</td></tr><tr><td>MR band 4 / 4 area† / complex study</td><td>£55.00</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>† Contiguous or overlapping areas in same acquisition i.e. abdomen and pelvis</p></blockquote><p>Banded activities are mapped to descriptive terms of reference commonly used for radiological activity based on combinations of NICIP codes. To successfully utilise the tariff system, normalisation of usage of NICIP codes is necessary. <a href="https://airtable.com/shrbvdfjlW2GOT1Dx/tblfjDTT1LWVTT4IP">View the NICIP lookup table we maintain</a></p><h4 id="the-great-body-part-debate">The great body part debate</h4><p>Radiologists who carry out additional work have long debated what constitutes <em>a part</em> and we are in full appreciation of the limitations of each method of counting beans. The YIC tariff system uses the term <em>banding</em> to avoid this territory. A band can equate to body parts but can also be used to indicate a higher level of complexity.</p><p>Special Interest Groups will be allowed to ask for review of tariffs in specialist areas if they consider the price band currently rated for a procedure to be a mismatch to the actual level of complexity and time required for the task. However, this claim will also be measured against the average reporting time for the claimed activity.</p><h4 id="comparison-and-complexity">Comparison and Complexity</h4><p>Comparison to prior imaging is part and parcel of the act of modern radiological interpretation and reporting. However, we would acknowledge that some examinations necessitate comparison of more images than others and may therefore take longer. It would be our recommendation that studies of this nature and complexity are better carried out during scheduled reporting sessions. However by listening to the feedback received through our special interest groups we are prepared to consider rebanding of examinations to reflect time taken on a task. Time on task will be monitored by our business intelligence unit to provide supporting evidence.</p><h4 id="how-prices-are-managed">How prices are managed</h4><p>Pricing will change with time and will not remain frozen at these levels forever. Adjustments will be made on a quarterly basis where necessary based on the following factors for consideration at Transformation Design Authority Board meetings.</p><ol><li>Overall NHS tariff for the procedure</li><li>Market rate in outsourcing-land</li><li>Rated complexity by Special Interest Group</li><li>Average time to report (based on our business analytics)</li></ol><h2 id="network-governance">Network Governance</h2><p>The primary care site of a patient holds the responsibility for governance around the standard of care a patient receives. This rule also holds true for diagnostic imaging executed by or on behalf of the Trust but reported by an outside agency (either insource or outsource reported). In practice, this means that complaints and incidents arising for a patient are investigated within the Trust holding responsibility for the relevant care episode.</p><p>We also have some additional guidance around the investigation of <a href="https://yorkshireimaging.nhs.uk/peer-learning/#serious-untoward-events">Serious untoward events in imaging</a> arising from work carried out in the insource network.</p><p>Whilst it is the responsibility of a Trust to carry out investigatory work, YIC does strongly encourage peer feedback to the parties involved in a constructive and educational manner. We also have a <a href="https://yorkshireimaging.nhs.uk/peer-learning/">peer learning</a> mechanism with a regional Radiology Events and Learning Meeting to ensure that the lessons learned from events are shared for improvement.</p><h2 id="critical-alerting-standard">Critical Alerting Standard</h2><p>Since there is no established and standardised coding system for critical alerts, YIC will adopt their usual <strong>minimum accepted standard</strong> approach in order to assure the expedited alerting of findings in 2 key categories.</p><ul><li>Significant finding ( text alert code <strong>#ALERTSIGNIFICANT</strong> )</li><li>Suspected cancer ( text alert code <strong>#ALERTCANCER</strong> )</li></ul><p>Organisations participating in the YIC Insource Network are known to have a diverse range of bespoke alert codes. They will be required to add the above codes to their alerting mechanism. Our analysis of all Trust alerting systems indicates that alerts for the two above event situations are in place in all sites, but the codes specified above will need mapping to the appropriate downstream triggers for each site.</p><p>Assistance will be offered to Trusts by the YIC Insource Team to effectively implement these simple text alert codes.</p><h2 id="insource-reporting-pilot">Insource Reporting Pilot</h2><p>In Q2 2022 (Starting late April 2022) we will be conducting a pilot of the cross-site reporting functionality of the Yorkshire Imaging Collaborative utilising our Intelerad Cloud PACS. Participants in the early pilot will need to be substantiative Consultant Radiologists from one of the member Trusts, and will be provided a short remotely delivered training session by Intelerad.</p><p>Studies reported during the Pilot will be remunerated at the rates outlined in the <a href="#regional-tariff-system">Regional Tariff System</a>. Work is automatically accounted for during the reporting process and passed to your Trust payroll for inclusion in the following monthly salary. At this stage payment will be limited to those on the NHS PAYE payroll system.</p><p>Expressions of interest to participate as a Pilot Reporter can be made to <a href="yorkshireimagingcollaborative@nhs.net">yorkshireimagingcollaborative@nhs.net</a></p></div><aside id="sideBar" class="lg:pl-8 mt-5 lg:mt-0 lg:w-1/3"><h3 id="sideBarTitle" class="block font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-3">Contents</h3><nav class="toc"><ol><li><a href="#why-reinvent-the-wheel%3F">Why reinvent the wheel?</a><ol><li><a href="#benefits-of-yic-insource">Benefits of YIC-insource</a></li><li><a href="#infrastructure-for-insourcing">Infrastructure for insourcing</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#making-use-of-insourcing">Making use of Insourcing</a><ol><li><a href="#charging">Charging</a></li><li><a href="#nicip-coding">NICIP coding</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#regional-tariff-system">Regional Tariff System</a></li><li><a href="#network-governance">Network Governance</a></li><li><a href="#critical-alerting-standard">Critical Alerting Standard</a></li><li><a href="#insource-reporting-pilot">Insource Reporting Pilot</a></li></ol></nav></aside></div></main><footer class="footer bg-grey-4 border-t-4 border-blue leading-loose text-secondary text-base print:hidden"><div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 lg:flex lg:flex-wrap"><ul class="list-reset lg:flex lg:flex-wrap max-w-3xl"><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/groups/">Special Interest Groups</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/groups/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/technology/">Technology</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/test-hub-page/">Test Hub Page</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/about-our-network/">About our network</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/business-intelligence/">Business Intelligence</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/insourcing/">Insourcing</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/peer-learning-feedback/">Peer Learning &amp; Feedback</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/reviewschedule/">Version Control</a></li><li class="lg:mr-8"><a href="/team/">Meet the Team</a></li></ul><span class="inline-block ml-auto mt-4 lg:mt-0">© Crown copyright</span><p class="w-full mt-8"><svg class="inline-block mr-2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="17" width="41" role="presentation" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 483.2 195.7"><path fill="currentColor" d="M421.5 142.8V.1l-50.7 32.3v161.1h112.4v-50.7zm-122.3-9.6A47.12 47.12 0 0 1 221 97.8c0-26 21.1-47.1 47.1-47.1 16.7 0
